Poland O
and O
other O
European O
countries O
to O
regain O
property O
stolen O
from O
Jews O
during O
World O
War O
II O
. O

But O
the O
World O

, O
whose O
members O
are O
mainly O
comprised O
of O
survivors O
of O
pre O
- O
war O
European O
Jewry O
, O
complain O
that O
they O
have O
been O
unable O

Hasidic O
Jews O
. O
They O
are O
forbidden O
from O
suing O
other O
Jews O
in O
a O
state O
court O

in O
a O
beit O
din O

assets O
from O
Switzerland O
and O
elsewhere O
, O
but O
are O
frequently O
divided O
on O
how O
to O
do O
it O
and O
how O
to O
distribute O
the O
recovered O
monies O
afterwards O
. O

While O
the O
World O
Council O
represents O
thousands O
of O
Hasidic O
Jews O
, O
it O
has O
remained O
outside O
the O
fold O
of O
more O
mainstream O
Jewish O
organizations O
. O

The O
WJRO O
, O
on O
the O

organization O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
issue O
of O
Jewish O
restitution O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
World O
Council O
' O
s O
members O
are O
originally O
from O
eastern O
European O
countries O
where O
restitution O
of O
Jewish O
property O
is O
again O
becoming O
a O
key O
issue O
. O

The O
World O
Council O
claims O
to O
have O
lost O
synagogues O
, O
Torahs O
and O
other O
communal O
properties O
to O
the O
Nazis O

But O
they O
complain O
that O
, O
because O
the O
WJRO O
is O
handling O
all O
negotiations O
, O
they O
cannot O
get O
their O
claims O
addressed O
. O

The O
World O
Council O
is O
also O
a O
plaintiff O
in O
a O
class O

action O
lawsuit O
brought O
by O
Holocaust O
