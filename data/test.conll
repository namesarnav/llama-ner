European O
countries O
to O
regain O
property O

But O
the O
World O

, O
whose O
members O
are O
mainly O
comprised O
of O
survivors O
of O
pre O

war O
European O
Jewry O
, O
complain O
that O
they O
have O
been O
unable O
to O

Hasidic O
Jews O
. O
They O
are O
forbidden O
from O
suing O
other O
Jews O
in O
a O
state O
court O

rabbis O
in O
a O
beit O
din O

frequently O
divided O
on O
how O
to O
do O
it O
and O
how O
to O
distribute O
the O
recovered O
monies O
afterwards O
. O

While O
the O
World O

represents O
thousands O
of O
Hasidic O
Jews O
, O
it O
has O
remained O
outside O

The O
WJRO O

originally O
from O

where O
restitution O
of O
Jewish O

, O
because O
the O
WJRO O

handling O
all O
negotiations O
, O
they O
cannot O
get O
their O

addressed O
. O

Despite O
their O

, O
rural O

have O
difficulties O

restrictions O
finding O
permanent O
employment O
and O
enrolling O
their O

in O

. O
Han O
says O
this O
is O
because O
of O
the O
country O
' O

decades O

system O
which O
makes O
it O
hard O
for O

If O

" O
Let O

" O
If O
Christ O

with O

Father O
, O
we O
cannot O
fail O
to O
utter O
these O
words O

We O
cannot O
fail O
to O
undertake O
the O
difficult O

necessary O
pilgrimage O
of O
forgiveness O
, O
which O
leads O
to O
a O
profound O
reconciliation O
, O
" O
the O
pontiff O
said O
. O

For O
some O
, O
the O
message O
itself O
would O
help O
spread O
peace O
. O

" O
This O
is O
a O
big O
event O
, O
it O
will O
bring O
peace O
, O

Others O
thought O
tolerance O

might O
take O

" O
It O
will O
take O
some O

before O
everyone O
forgives O

there O
were O

" O
Of O

forgiveness O
, O
far O
from O

because O
an O

But O
it O

Throughout O
the B-T

have O
expressed O
gloom O
about O
the O
Hong O

with O
EU O
Trade O
Commissioner O

saying O
the O
talks O
would O

The O
so O

called O
Doha O
round O
of O
WTO O
talks O
, O
launched O
in O
the O
Qatari O
capital O
of O
Doha O
in O
2001 B-T
, O
has O
bogged O
down O
in O
a O
bitter O
dispute O
over O
agricultural O
subsidies O
which O
has O
pitted O
mainly O
rich O
nations O
against O
developing O
nations O
. O

Developing O
countries O
also O
argue O
that O
farm O
subsidies O
in O
rich O
nations O
such O
as O
the O
United O

and O
EU O
countries O
depress O
global O
prices O

from O
competing O
. O

The O
European O
Union O
has O
rejected O
demands O
by O
the O
United O

, O
Australia O
and O
some O
other O
APEC O
members O
to O
impose O
greater O
cuts O
in O

WTO O
members O
should O
" O
make O
further O
, O
meaningful O
contributions O
to O
move O
the O
negotiations O
forward O
, O
" O
said O
the O
APEC O
statement O

" O
Doing O
this O
will O
require O
economically O
and O
politically O
difficult O
decisions O
by O
all O
WTO O
members O
. O
" O

Expectations O
were O
shrinking O
and O
hopes O
plummeting O
after O

earlier B-T
this I-T
month I-T
in O
Geneva O

London O
failed O
to O
end O

The O
statement O
said O
that O
while O
the O
initial O
expectations O
of O
the O
Hong O

may O
not O
be O
achieved O
, O
" O
we O

nonetheless O
not O

Participants O
at O
the O
APEC O

were O
working O
hard O
to O
come O
up O
with O
a O
statement O
for O
their O
leaders O
to O
sign O
off O
. O

The O
statement O
was O
expected O
to O
support O
the O
WTO O
, O
thus O
giving O
a O
boost O
to O
the O
staggering O

" O
What O
is O
needed O
at O
this O
moment O
is O
a O
strong O
message O
from O

to O
keep O
spirits O
up O
, O
" O
said O
one O
participant O
, O
who O
refused O
identification O
. O

Some O
participants O
, O
however O
, O
were O
worried O
about O
the O

meeting O
becoming O
a O
repeat O
of O

bogged O

believe O
that O

continue O

an O
expanded O
search O
for O

according O
to O
a O

About O
54 O
percent O
of O
the O

argued O
that O
construction O

some O
to O
believe O
the O

not O
extensive O
enough O

One O
respondent O
said O
he O
believed O
the O
construction O

keep O
going O

stick O
to O
the O

, O
as O
it O
will O
take O
a O
long O
time O
to O
actually O
to O
uncover O
everything O
. O
But O
another O
believed O
the O

stop O

they O
keep O

" O
Out O
of O
respect O

the O

" O
It O
' O

very O

for O
anything O
in O

Besides O
fitness O

" O

Just O
from O

in O

of O

it O
was O
just O
a O

sore O
. O
But O
the O
movement O
is O
more O
of O
an O
issue O
. O
" O

The O

" O
Last O

it O

" O
But O
it O

I O
hope O

" O
We O
think O
that O
in O

those O
positions O

required O

Kibwana O
also O
said O
that O
Africa O
emphasizes O
an O
equitable O
distribution O
of O
CDM O
projects O
. O
Part O
of O
the O
debates O
at O
the O

is O
on O
how O
to O
ensure O
the O
capacity O
of O
African O
and O
poor O
countries O
to O
develop O

projects O
which O
permit O

while O

concerned O

the O

" O
According O
to O

it O
is O
clear O
that O
the O

an O
extremely O
serious O

We O
can O
not O
postpone O
on O
how O

that O
is O

go O

by O
crusading O
knight O
Geoffroy O
de O

, O
after O
the O

. O

It O
is O
believed O
the O
current O

is O
not O
the O
one O
that O
disappeared O
from O

. O

Without O
taking O
a O

, O
the O

holds O
the O

who O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
be O
a O
part O

the O

" O

In O

noted O
that O
responsibility O
for O
the O

was O

claimed O
by O
the O
Palestinian O
Islamic O
Jihad O
, O
which O
has O
its O

been O
behind O
all O

" O
So O
if O
anybody O
needed O
a O
reminder O
, O
this O
is O
it O
, O
that O
the O
Syrian O
government O
should O
take O
immediate O
steps O

crack O
down O

Much O
of O
the O
bickering O
is O
over O

But O
the O

when O

Senator O

told O
US O

this B-T

that O
Iraq O
more O

All O

made O

taking O
Abat O

Though O

Arroyo O

Colonel O

that O

to O
join O

that O
the O
military O
would O
not O
specify O
. O

" O
I O
have O
deemed O
it O
proper O
to O
relieve O
him O
because O
he O
had O
been O

was O
being O
hatched O
against O
Arroyo O
whose O
approval O

due O
to O
a O
six O

Stephen O

the O

be O
disadvantageous O

it O
would O

come O
up O

as O
to O

become O
more O

in O
the O

, O
White O

said O
late B-T

that O
" O

" O
Amid O

were O
also O

upbeat O
in O

, O
with O
one O
even O
talking O
of O
victory O
within O
a O

week O
. O

But O
even O
continued O
military O
success O
carries O
political O
and O

diplomatic O
risks O
for O
President O
Bush O
and O
the O
U O
. O
S O
. O
The O
allied O

rejection O
of O
the O
last O
- O
minute O
Soviet O
- O
led O
diplomatic O
effort O
to O
avoid O
the O
ground O
war O
enabled O
Mr O

Bush O
to O
seize O
the O
initiative O

from O
an O
Iraq O
seemingly O
bent O
on O
dictating O
peace O
terms O
. O
But O
it O

has O
offended O
some O
, O
especially O
in O
Arab O
countries O
, O
who O
now O
believe O
that O
Mr O
. O
Bush O
' O
s O
real O
objectives O
are O
the O
demise O
of O

Saddam O
Hussein O
and O
the O
destruction O
of O
the O
Iraqi O
military O
, O
not O

just O
the O
liberation O
of O
Kuwait O
. O

" O
Why O
have O
a O
war O
? O
" O
asked O
Abdul O
Latif O
Shekar O
, O
a O
customs O

officer O
in O
Egypt O
, O
a O
country O
participating O
in O
the O
attack O
on O

Iraqi O
troops O
. O
" O
I O
think O
the O
Gorbachev O
plan O
was O
a O
good O
one O
. O

Iraq O
was O
ready O
to O
withdraw O
. O
" O
Now O
, O
he O
says O
, O
" O
it O
looks O
like O
the O

West O
just O
wants O
to O
destroy O
Iraq O
. O
" O

Despite O
the O
early O
indications O
of O
success O
, O
the O
allied O

forces O
could O
still O
suffer O
greater O
casualties O
and O
become O

bogged O
down O
militarily O
, O
especially O
when O
they O
encounter O
the O

tough O
Republican O
Guard O
, O
which O
is O
entrenched O
along O
the O

Iraq O
- O
Kuwait O
border O
. O
If O
so O
, O
and O
if O
it O
appears O
that O
the O

American O
goal O
actually O
is O
to O
destroy O
the O
Iraqi O
regime O
even O
at O

the O
cost O
of O
badly O
hurting O
Iraqi O
society O
, O
" O
the O
lingering O
cost O

of O
that O
could O
be O
high O
, O
" O
worries O
former O
national O
security O

adviser O
Zbigniew O
Brzezinski O
. O
But O
, O
he O
notes O
, O
" O
If O
everything O

crumbles O
totally O
, O
that O
won O
' O
t O
be O
such O
a O
problem O
. O
" O

American O
officials O
staunchly O
disavow O
any O
interest O
in O

driving O
through O
Iraq O
toward O
Baghdad O
, O
either O
in O
pursuit O
of O

Saddam O
Hussein O
himself O
or O
to O
set O
up O
some O
American O
- O
controlled O

government O
inside O
Iraq O
. O
The O
Americans O
say O
their O
battle O
plans O

call O
for O
operating O
against O
forces O
inside O
Iraq O
as O
far O
north O
as O

the O
city O
of O
Basra O
, O
about O
30 O
miles O
north O
of O
Kuwait O
, O
but O
say O

there O
is O
n O
' O
t O
any O
plan O
to O
drive O
beyond O
that O
. O

Indeed O
, O
French O
President O
Francois O
Mitterrand O
said O

yesterday B-T
that O
some O
allied O
forces O
are O
crossing O
Iraqi O

territory O
as O
part O
of O
a O
" O
pincer O
" O
movement O
to O
trap O
the O
soldiers O

occupying O
Kuwait O
, O
but O
insisted O
, O
" O
The O
purpose O
isn O
' O
t O
to O
invade O

Iraqi O
territory O
, O
that O
' O
s O
not O
the O
aim O
, O
that O
isn O
' O
t O
the O
mandate O
. O
" O

Nevertheless O
, O
American O
officials O
over O
the B-T
weekend I-T
became O

more O
open O
in O
declaring O
that O
by O
destroying O
Saddam O
Hussein O
' O
s O

military O
machine O
they O
hope O
to O
destroy O
his O
regime O
- O
- O
a O
goal O

likely O
to O
be O
supported O
by O
most O
Americans O
. O

In O

Lt O
. O
Gen O

Walter O

, O
the O

" O

Secretary O
of O

James O

said O
on O
ABC O

TV O
' O

" O
This O
Week O

With O
David O

that O
the O
series O
of O

resolutions O
condemning O

' O

invasion O
of O

" O
imply O
that O

the O
restoration O
of O
peace O
and O
stability O
in O
the O

would O
be O
a O

heck O
of O
a O
lot O
easier O
if O
he O
and O
that O
leadership O
were O
not O
in O

power O
in O
Iraq O
. O
" O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
still O
far O
too O
early O
to O
assume O
that O
the O

military O
situation O
on O
the O
ground O
will O
stay O
as O
smooth O
for O

allied O
forces O
as O
it O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
so O
far O
. O
Iraq O
still O

has O
the O
potential O
to O
cause O
significant O
problems O
by O
using O

forces O
and O
weapons O
that O
don O
' O
t O
yet O
seem O
fully O
engaged O
. O

For O
one O
thing O
, O
Iraq O
still O
apparently O
has O
n O
' O
t O
unleashed O
its O

stockpile O
of O
chemical O
weapons O
. O
Gen O
. O
Schwarzkopf O
said O
that O

some O
early O
reports O
that O
chemical O
weapons O
were O
used O
against O

allied O
troops O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
" O
bogus O
. O
" O
Iraq O
is O
believed O
to O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
deliver O
chemical O
weapons O
in O
artillery O

shells O
or O
, O
perhaps O
, O
atop O
Soviet O
- O
made O
Frog7 O
missiles O
. O

Perhaps O
more O
important O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
allied O
troops O

have O
n O
' O
t O
yet O
fully O
engaged O
Iraq O
' O
s O
vaunted O
Republican O
Guard O
, O

which O
has O
been O
sitting O
just O
north O
of O
the O
Iraq O
- O
Kuwait O
border O

and O
is O
considered O
the O
most O
potent O
element O
in O
the O
Iraqi O

defense O
. O
It O
remains O
to O
be O
seen O
how O
much O
damage O
the O
allied O
air O

campaign O
was O
able O
to O
inflict O
on O
the O
Guard O
, O
and O
whether O

President O

will O
commit O
his O
most O
valued O
troops O
to O
a O

fight O
- O
to O
- O
the O
- O
death O

Certainly O
Saddam O

continues O
to O
implore O
his O
country O

to O
fight O
on O
. O
" O
Fight O
them O
, O
" O
he O
urged O
Iraqis O
in O
a O
radio O

address O
. O
" O
All O
Iraqis O
, O
fight O
them O
with O
all O
the O

, O

and O
all O

for O
everything O
. O
" O

American O
war O
planners O
have O
long O
assumed O
that O
the O
early O

stage O
of O
the O
ground O
attack O
, O
in O
which O
American O
forces O
would O
use O
their O
speed O
to O
sweep O
around O
Iraqi O
defenses O
and O
their O

strength O
to O
punch O
through O
the O
relatively O
weak O
Iraqi O
front O

line O
, O
would O
be O
the O
easiest O
part O
. O

Despite O
these O
early O
successes O
, O
the O
mere O
fact O
that O
a O
ground O

campaign O
has O
begun O
almost O
guarantees O
that O
the O
Bush O

administration O
will O
face O
fresh O
problems O
growing O
out O
of O
the O

military O
situation O
. O
There O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
additional O

American O
prisoners O
of O

taken O
, O

there O
are O
signs O
that O

President O

is O
taking O
Kuwaiti O
hostages O

U O

numbers O
of O

civilians O
from O
Kuwait O
City O
are O
being O
rounded O
up O
and O
held O
by O

Iraqi O
troops O

apparently O
either O
for O
use O
as O
human O
shields O
or O

for O
use O
later O
in O
bargaining O
once O
the O
war O
is O
over O
. O

President O
Bush O
' O
s O
political O
argument O
for O
going O
to O
a O
ground O

war O
has O
been O
strengthened O
by O
the O
growing O
stream O
of O
reports O
of O

wanton O
Iraqi O
destruction O
inside O

Mr O

Bush O

military O

conclusion O

the O
crisis O
even O
before O
the O

came O

The O

on O

that O
a O

be O
necessary O
. O
The O
decision O

Colin O

Then O
, O

The B-T

was O

real O
problem O
with O
the O

now O
say O
, O
was O
that O
they O
all O
would O

required O

lifting O

The O

considers O
the O

essential O
to O
keeping O

Saddam O

under O
control O
should O
he O
survive O
the O

Mr O

Bush O
forestalled O
further O
diplomatic O
maneuvering O

issuing O
an O
ultimatum O
on O

of O

that O

withdraw O
within B-T
a I-T
week I-T
, O
starting O
at O

Administration O

said O
that O
the O
idea O

was O

Gen O

argued O
setting O

him O
a B-T

to O
withdraw O
fully O
, O
instead O
of O
the B-T
four I-T

Outside O

I O

Despite O
the O
lack O
of O
any O
obvious O
successors O

the O
Iraqi O

leader O
' O

internal O
power O
base O
appeared O
to O
be O
narrowing O

before O

Some O

appeared O
to O
be O
relying O

relatives O
. O
If O
that O
' O
s O
true O
, O
the O
narrowing O
of O
his O

would O
make O
it O
easier O
for O
someone O
to O
push O
him O
aside O
from O

Yet O
, O
paradoxically O
, O
the O
perception O
that O
the O

' O

decision O

punish O
the O

wheat O
exporter O
for O
bribing O
the O
ousted O
Iraqi O
regime O
by O
barring O
it O
from O

would O
have O
no O

US O
Agriculture O
Secretary O
Mike O

announced O
overnight O
the O
suspension O

as O

as O
11 O

, O
from O

participation O
in O

such O
as O

However O
AWB O
spokesman O
Peter O
McBride O
said O
the O
US O
Department O
of O
Agriculture O
' O
s O
( O
USDA O
) O
move O
would O
have O
little O
practical O
effect O
as O
the O

had O
not O
used O
US O
subsidies O
since O
early B-T
2004 I-T
. O

" O
As O
we O
haven O
' O

used O

we O

" O

We O

' O

" O

McBride O
said O
there O
seemed O
to O
have O
been O
some O
misunderstanding O
as O
AWB O
had O
yet O
to O
receive O

adjusted O
quarterly O
and O
will O
reflect O
the O
rate O
of O

conditions O

The O
adjustments O
result O
from O
the O
recently O
passed O
thrift O
- O
industry O
bailout O
legislation O
, O
which O
requires O
thrifts O
to O
divest O
all O

by O

Previously O
, O
Columbia O
did O
n O
' O

have O
to O
adjust O
the O
book O
value O
of O
its O
junk O
- O
bond O
holdings O
to O
reflect O
declines O
in O
market O
prices O
, O
because O
it O
held O
the O
bonds O
as O
long O
- O
term O
investments O
. O

Because O
Columbia O
now B-T
must O
sell O
the O
bonds O
within O
five B-T
years I-T
, O
accounting O
rules O
require O
the O
thrift O
to O
value O
the O
bonds O
at O
the O
lower O
of O
cost O
or O
market O
prices O
. O

For O
its O
future O
strategy O
, O
Columbia O
officials O
said O
the O
thrift O
may O
branch O
out O
into O
commercial O
lending O
or O
managing O
outside O
investments O
, O
as O
well O
as O
beefing O
up O

Thomas O
Spiegel O
, O
Columbia O
' O

chairman O

said O
in O
a O

that O
the O

was O
" O
disappointed O
" O
by O
the O
effects O
of O
the O

changes O
. O

But O
he O
said O
Columbia O
remains O
" O
one O
of O
the O

when O

t O
know O
how O
quickly O
they O
will O
dispose O

, O
because O
federal O

those O
that O

' O

said O
the O

despite O
the O
large O

The O

emphasized O
that O

Although O

the O
transactions O

Columbia O
said O
the O

The O
Asian O
Development O
Bank O
( O
ADB O
) O
said O
Saturday B-T
it O
was O
lending O
320 O
million O
dollars O
to O
help O
the O
poor O
in O
Pakistan O
obtain O
access O
to O
wider O
financial O
services O
, O
including O
microfinance O
. O

The O
loans O
would O
go O
to O
developing O
a O
legal O
and O
regulatory O
framework O
and O
removing O
bottlenecks O
that O
would O
allow O
more O
of O
the O
country O
' O
s O
poor O
access O
to O
financial O
networks O
, O
the O
ADB O
said O
in O
a O
statement O
from O
its O
headquarters O
in O
the O
Philippine O
capital O
. O

This O
would O
include O
improving O
technology O
for O
delivering O
financial O
services O
more O
efficiently O
and O
at O
lower O
cost O
and O
expanding O
the O
range O
and O
quality O
of O
financial O
products O
and O
services O
" O
including O
those O
for O
the O
Islamic O
market O
" O
, O
the O
ADB O
said O
. O

The O
bank O
would O
also O
work O
to O
set O
up O
public O
- O
private O
partnerships O
, O
including O
reliable O
business O
and O
credit O
information O
systems O
as O
well O
as O
improved O
, O
reliable O
and O
lower O
- O
cost O
remittance O
services O
for O
overseas O
workers O
. O

" O
There O
is O
a O
large O
potential O
demand O
for O
microfinance O
services O
among O
the O
poorest O
people O
in O
Pakistan O
, O
especially O
for O
savings O
and O
remittances O
facilities O
, O
" O
the O
ADB O
said O
. O

Microfinance O
reaches O
fewer O
than O
a O
million O
people O
in O
Pakistan O
, O
even O
though O
the O
potential O
market O
is O
about O
20 O
million O
people O
, O
the O
bank O
added O
. O

While O
the O
microfinance O
sector O
has O
improved O
, O
it O
still O
does O
not O
touch O
vast O
numbers O
of O
people O
. O
This O
could O
be O
addressed O
by O
expanding O
the O
financial O
sector O
' O

coverage O
, O
making O
it O
more O
inclusive O
and O

better O

on O

court O
( O
against O

, O
and O
that O
' O
s O
why O
it O
feels O
frustrating O
because O
some O

just O
went O
out O
that O

were O

" O
I O
had O
problems O
with O
him O
because O
he O
was O
playing O
just O
unbelievable O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O
I O
think O
he O
played O
really O
high O

class O
tennis O
in O
the O
first O
set O
, O
but O
I O
was O
also O
expecting O
his O
pace O
is O
going O
to O
drop O
because O
he O
dropped O
against O
Nalbandian O
, O
and O
I O
know O
he O
' O

not O
in O

I O

waiting O
my O

and O
they O
came O

and O
I O
took O
them O
. O
" O

" O
But O
I O
mean O
, O
Federer O
is O
not O
struggling O
. O
I O
just O
think O
that O
he O
' O
s O
not O
top O
fit O
. O
He O
' O
s O
not O
sharp O
as O
he O
usually O
is O

. O
I O
just O
tried O

it O

said O

" O

" O
I O
expected O
a O
close O
match O
. O
I O
thought O
maybe O
he O
was O
even O
slightly O
the O
favorite O
because O
of O
what O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
going O
through O
the B-T
last I-T

. O
Obviously O
, O
I O
' O
m O
very O
pleased O

is O
a O
win O
no O
matter O
if O
it O
' O

two O
or O
three O
sets O
. O

to O
treat O
on O
his O
sore O
ankle O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O

" O
I O

it O

The O

a O

for O

the O
only O

He O
said O
the O

The O
changeover O
to O
the O

foresees O
that O

will O
circulate O
simultaneously O
for O
only O
the B-T
first I-T
two I-T

To O
prevent O
a O
rounding O

as O
has O
happened O
when O
other O
nations O
changed O
over O
to O
the O

, O
the O

introduced O
last B-T
March I-T
the O
double O
labelling O
of O

, O
in O
euros O

tolars O
, O
and O
this O
will O
remain O
in O
force O
for O
six B-T

. O

Despite O
this O
measure O
, O
inflation O
in O
December B-T
increased O

But O
Gaspari O
said O
: O
" O
We O
can O
' O

blame O
the O
euro O
for O
any O
increase O
of O
prices O
in O
December B-T

January I-T

there O

All O
were O
named O
by O
Fidel O

to O
back O
his O

in O
the O
interim O
. O

Since O
its O
creation O
in O
December B-T
1976 I-T
, O
the O
ANPP O
has O
always O
been O
Fidel O
Castro O
' O
s O
venue O
for O
laying O
out O
in O
detail O
the O
country O
' O
s O
direction O
. O
His O
long O
speeches O
dominated O
debates O
and O
usually O
led O
to O
unanimous O
votes O
backing O
his O
views O
. O

It O
will O
be O
only O
the O
second O
time O
in O
its O
30 O
- O
year O
history O
that O
Fidel O
will O
miss O
a O
session O
of O
the O
ANPP O
. O

With O
a O
more O
conservative O
, O
quieter O
style O
, O
Raul O
Castro O
will O
preside O
over O
the O
second O
of O
the O
two O
annual O
ANPP O
sessions O
. O
In O
December B-T
2002 I-T
, O
his O
absence O
was O
attributed O
to O
complications O
from O
a O
mosquito O
bite O
. O

In O
the B-T
days I-T
ahead O

the O
meeting O
, O
there O
has O
been O
no O

that O
he O
will O
break O
from O

The O

review O

all O

questions O
about O

" O
We O
cannot O

choose O
this O
moment O
to O
make O
important O

such O
as O

down O
the O

for O
a O

, O
" O
said O
a O
diplomat O
from O
a O
friendly O
Latin O
American O
country O
. O

The O
diplomat O
said O
Fidel O
Castro O
' O
s O
" O
political O
wisdom O
" O
could O
inspire O
an O
announcement O
. O

However O
, O
he O
cautioned O
, O
" O
His O
temperament O

fierce O
fighter O
doesn O
' O

suggest O
that O
he O
would O
announce O
his O
withdrawal O
from O
politics O
prematurely O
. O
" O

With O

In O
a O
big O
setback O
to O
US O
President O
George O
W O
. O
Bush O
, O
the O
summit O
concluded O
on O
Saturday B-T
after O
adopting O
a O
final O
declaration O
that O
failed O
to O
clearly O
support O
the O
resumption O
of O
stalled O
talks O
on O
establishing O
a O
hemisphere O
- O
wide O
Free O
Trade O
Area O
of O
the O
Americas O
( O
FTAA O
) O
, O
which O
Washington O
had O
demanded O
. O

This O
is O
regarded O
as O
an O
ominous O
signal O
to O
Washington O
that O
the O
US O
ambition O
to O
set O
up O
the O
FTAA O
might O
eventually O
end O
up O
in O
failure O
. O

What O
is O
worse O
, O
Bush O
is O
suffering O
an O
image O
crisis O
as O
his O
presence O
here O
drew O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
protesters O
and O
violent O
clashes O
erupted O
between O
demonstrators O
and O
police O
here O
and O
across O
the O
country O
on O
Friday B-T
. O
Polls O
in O
many O
Latin O
American O
nations O
show O
Bush O
as O
the O
least O
popular O
US O
leader O
in O
decades O
. O

President O
Bush O
' O
s O
father O
, O
former O
President O
George O
Bush O
, O
first O
proposed O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
FTAA O
in O
the B-T
1990s I-T
and O
at O
the O
first O
Summit O
of O
the O
Americas O
in O
the O
United O
States O
in O
1994 B-T
, O
leaders O
from O
34 O
countries O
who O
attended O
the O
summit O
agreed O
to O
set O
up O
such O
a O
free O
trade O
zone O
, O
setting O
January B-T
2005 I-T
as O
the O
deadline O
. O

However O
, O
talks O
on O
such O
a O
zone O
have O
bogged O
down O
because O
of O
sharp O
disagreement O
between O
the O
United O
States O
and O
countries O
like O
Brazil O
, O
Argentina O
, O
Paraguay O
and O
Uruguay O
. O

President O
Bush O
has O
insisted O
that O
free O
trade O
is O
the O
best O
way O
to O
reduce O
poverty O
and O
create O
employment O
and O
he O
pushed O
for O
resuming O
such O
trade O
talks O
at O
the O
summit O
. O
However O
, O
Bush O
' O
s O
call O
fell O
on O
deaf O
ears O
. O

Argentina O
and O
Brazil O
, O
both O
major O
food O
exporters O
in O
Latin O
America O
, O
have O
made O
it O
clear O
that O
they O
do O
not O
want O
to O
join O
the O
FTAA O
as O
long O
as O
the O
United O
States O
does O
not O
remove O
agricultural O
subsidies O
. O
They O
complain O
that O
Washington O
' O
s O
agricultural O
subsidies O
would O
eliminate O
the O
competitiveness O
of O
farm O
products O
from O
other O
American O
countries O
and O
increase O
poverty O
in O
Latin O
America O
. O

Venezuelan O
President O
Hugo O
Chavez O
, O
an O
outspoken O
critic O
of O
the O
United O
States O
, O
has O
said O
the O
FTAA O
is O
" O
dead O
" O
as O
it O
only O
helps O
large O
US O
companies O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
Latin O
American O
workers O
. O

Historically O
speaking O
, O
Latin O
America O
, O
especially O
South O
America O
, O
has O
been O
cool O
to O
the O
US O
proposal O
of O
free O
trade O
and O
economic O
privatization O
as O
those O
Latin O
American O
governments O
that O
endorsed O
the O
Washington O
- O
backed O
policies O
were O
toppled O
one O
after O
another O
. O
To O
the O
dismay O
of O
Washington O
, O
key O
Latin O
American O
countries O
such O
as O
Argentina O
, O
Brazil O
, O
Chile O
and O
Venezuela O
have O
been O
shifting O
toward O
the O
left O
since O
then O
. O

Likewise O
, O
Bush O
' O
s O
call O
for O
fighting O
corruption O
and O
strengthening O
democracy O
, O
a O
central O
theme O
in O
his O
second O
term O
, O
has O
drawn O
lukewarm O
response O
from O
his O
Latin O
American O
counterparts O
at O
the O
Summit O
of O
the O
Americas O
. O

Argentine O
President O
Nestor O
Kirchner O
, O
in O
a O
joint O
press O
appearance O
with O
President O
Bush O
on O
Friday B-T
, O
warned O
that O
any O
US O
involvement O
in O
Latin O
America O
should O
be O
" O
positive O
and O
constructive O
, O
" O
a O
demand O
that O
Bush O
might O
find O
hard O
to O
accept O
. O

Bush O
' O
s O
call O
for O
strengthening O
democracy O
and O
fighting O
corruption O
has O
little O
market O
in O
Latin O
America O
where O
poverty O
reduction O
is O
more O
urgent O
than O
corruption O
and O
democracy O
. O

Moreover O
, O
Latin O
America O
has O
been O
complaining O
that O
the O
United O
States O
neglected O
the O
region O
due O
to O
the O
Iraq O
war O
and O
the O
war O
on O

Observers O
point O
out O
that O
the O
United O

, O
to O
restore O
its O
image O
and O
influence O
in O
its O
traditional O

, O
must O
first O
make O
genuine O
